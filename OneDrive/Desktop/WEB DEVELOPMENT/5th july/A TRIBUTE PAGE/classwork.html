    <PRE>On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she 
travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to leave 
the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith."[35]
Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become Mother Teresa".[36]
She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[24] replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton
sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical 
training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.[37][38] She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, 
before she began tending to the poor and hungry.[39] At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by 
a group of young women, and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor".</PRE>

    <PRE>In 1979, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize "for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress,
 which also constitutes a threat to peace".[115] She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 
cost be given to the poor in India[116] and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy.
When Mother Teresa received the prize she was asked, "What can we do to promote world peace?" She answered, "Go home and love your
family." Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty
of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of 
bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person
that has been thrown out from society –that poverty is so hurtable [sic] and so much, and I find that very difficult."</PRE>

    <PRE><I>The Decree of Praise was just the beginning, as Mother Teresa received various honors for her tireless and effective charity. 
She was awarded the Jewel of India, the highest honor bestowed on Indian civilians, as well as the now-defunct Soviet Union's 
Gold Medal of the Soviet <span style=" Committee". In 1979, MotherTeresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her work
"in bringing help to suffering humanity.</I></PRE>
